# P7

A project with dataset available on https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data

The core of this project was to evaluate probability of payment default for Credit Bureau's clients loan. 

For this work, I used a kernel available on kaggle, adapted some features for my needs and choose Light GBM Classifier as model.
The imbalanced problem was treated with scal pos weight and I threshold my results to have less false negative.

This project is not actually finished, but soon I will deploy the dashboard on Heroku
